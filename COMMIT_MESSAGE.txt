feat: Add cyberpunk astro radar visualization 🛸

Implemented interactive planetary radar chart according to spec 03_Specs/03.md

Backend changes:
- Added get_planet_data() to extract planet degrees from kerykeion
- Returns chart_data with 7 planets (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn)
- Each planet includes: name, absolute position (0-360°), and color

Frontend changes:
- Created AstroRadar component with SVG-based visualization
- Rotating radar with planets positioned by degrees
- Aspect lines connecting all planets (sacred geometry web)
- Smooth rotation animation (0.2° per 50ms)
- Scanning beam effect (4s rotation)
- Color-coded planets with pulse animation
- Integrated into ResultCard between data grid and verdict

Features:
✅ Real-time planet positions from API
✅ Cyberpunk color scheme
✅ Smooth animations and transitions
✅ Fallback to mock data if API unavailable
✅ Responsive design
✅ Sacred geometry visualization

Testing:
- Backend tested with test_radar_api.py
- Frontend components have no diagnostics
- Standalone demo available at frontend/public/radar-demo.html
